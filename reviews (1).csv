  idk why the camera quality degraded so much , i have a rn7pro and it's camera is far better than rn11pro+'s - most of the images are grainy .I noticed that it sometimes lags even though the storage isn't half full(hope a future update will solve it)

  Really liked this phone with awesome features such as 120hz super amoled display and 5000 MaH battery with 67W charging with a 108mp triple camera and a decent performance with snapdragon 695 with 7 5G bands support.As a user review I should recommend this for a everyday use phone and this phone is not a perfonmance centric phone but performance is decent.

  I'm describing this phone in some main points--  Fast processor- fingure touch response is fast- Battery backup is great- looks is good- camera is worst in this price range.- phone hanging problem in normal game like candy crush but pubg and cod working smoothly- fast charging is good- youtube videos highest resolution is 1080p- dual speakers are good Overall redmi is selling below 10k price phone in the high rate. Not worth to buy just for a fast charging.Thanks

  Basically a 15k-18k phone sold for 21k, sound is surely good and very loud but not loud enough for a device worth 20k+. Miui is buggy as usual, they won't solve simple issues which are plaguing all of their devices(including xiaomi and poco). 67 watt charging might be a gimmick, takes 1 hr for full charge while one plus nord 2 finishes in 30 mins with 4500 mah battery and poco f3 gt takes more or less 45 mins with 5065 mah. Idc about 4k, but as you all know..no 60 fps for 1080p which is a disappointment. Device lagged during multitasking while batt was low. Camera is also pretty average, for the price. Nice display, and the blue model looks great.

  Â + Camera is good. You have the 'pro' section where you can adjust all the settings if you know. Quality is good.+Refresh rate is impressive.+Speakers on both ends+Charging is good but not as fast as 15 mins with the charger. Also, the charger is too heavy to carry along.- I transferred my data from my old phone to this which made the phone quite hot. This creates a doubt om the liquid cooling system.- I experienced some lagging while loading the home screen.Overall, I'm a bit worried about the minus points here for the longer run and with this price range.

  The processor 'might' be a little degrade for the high-performance users or gamers but indeed this is the best phone for the daily normal users and even more than that. The battery is really good and the camera is above avg.Also the chef's kiss to its elite design and display, which is far better than most of the flagship phones out there...

  Blue, Ram/ROM- 8GB+256GBI bought this phone more than 1 week ago and today we received phone at doorstep, after using it for few hours only, I can say, Iâ€™m totally satisfied with my purchase. This one is a totally amazing flagship device.The charging on this one is blazing fast. I was skeptical of the 20-25 mins claim but after purchasing, Iâ€™m getting 30-35 mins full charge time and that is better than anything else available in the market right now.The 108mp primary camera is just amazing, it gets such nice pictures.There is dual 5g sim slot which supports upto 13 5G bands, so yes, this is going to be a solid future-proof device when it comes to connectivityYou can also record video in all formats which I think is not possible in the majority of smartphones available out there in the market.
